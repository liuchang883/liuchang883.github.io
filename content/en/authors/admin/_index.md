I am a master’s student in Industrial Design at Tsinghua University, where I explore how **interactive systems, game-based learning**, and **mixed reality** can be leveraged to support knowledge construction, emotional engagement, and behavior change. My work is grounded in a deep interest in **embodied interaction, educational technology**, and **human-centered design for emerging technologies**—particularly within the domains of science learning, child-AI interaction, and digital health.

I have published in leading venues such as **CHI, HRI, HCII**, and **IASDR**, and have received multiple academic honors, including the **2025 Beijing Municipal Outstanding Graduate (Top 5%), 2024 Tsinghua University Outstanding First-Class Scholarship**, and the **2020 National Scholarship (Top 1%)**. My interdisciplinary background spans creative product design, physical computing, and immersive interaction, and I aim to continue pushing the boundaries of how design can translate abstract systems into meaningful and accessible experiences.

I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities starting in **Spring or Fall 2026**, focusing on the intersection of **design, interaction, and cognition** in educational or health-related contexts.
